Graduated in Biology (UPV/EHU) and master’s in Environmental Agrobiology (UPV/EHU), I am currently working on a doctoral thesis on ‘resurrection’ plants. In the current situation of climate change, plants are facing increasingly frequent and intense temperatures and desiccation. In line with this, I am studying plants that are able to withstand long periods of time with very low water content and revive quickly after watering. By further studying the mechanisms of tolerance to environmental stresses, and identifying the phylogenetic, geoclimatic, habitat and morphological characteristics of the ‘resurrection’ species, I want to understand how life can continue under extreme conditions.
