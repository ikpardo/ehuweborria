Our consolidated research group (IT1022-16) analyzes the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and the main stresses associated (temperature change, drought, nitrogen fertilization and their interaction) on the growth and productivity of diverse crops. In addition, our group evaluates plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions and plant functional ecology in semi-natural mountain grassland. Our research is devoted to improve the understanding of climate change impacts on agro-pastoral systems and to find solutions that respond to both present and future society demands for food security and environmental sustainability, 

The main objectives of the research group are: (a) to improve the understanding of the adaptation
mechanisms of species to climate change by identifying plant physiological and molecular tolerance traits; (b) to evaluate the effect of climate change on plant production and nutraceutical quality; and (c) to search strategies to minimize the impact of climate change on crops and grazing systems in order to secure to sustainable plant production and food security.
